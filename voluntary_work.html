    <hr>
     <p>I have never done any voluntary experience because I was always lazy to do any work and I only really liked playing video games until when I dropped out in grade 11 and I thought to myself that I need something to earn money so I started working at Mcdonalds and earn some money because i wanted to be useful and not a loser and an obese person and I can also get Mcdonalds for my buddies and my family</p>
