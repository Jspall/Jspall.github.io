      <h2>Kobe Bryant wins his first oscar</h2>
      <hr>
      <p> Former NBA superstar Kobe Bryant says "winning an oscar feels better than winning an NBA chapionship to be honest with y'all". Kobe was nominated for the award as he made a peom and wanted to turn it into a short film. The film is about having an emotional dream, believing it will come true, it comes true then waking up to having another dream to achieve and move on.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown, considered softmore, takes a scary fall! As the minesota Timberwolves try to score at the other end, Jaylen Brown grabs the rebound and leads the fast-break. As he tries to go up for the slam, he dunks the ball but lets go of the hoop immediately making him fall awkwardly on the ground. Even though it looks as he had a major injury, he later on tweets saying "appreciate everybody I'm ok. Got a headache tho. Good team win!!".

Demar Derozan also did so work as he had 23 points and in addition to that, he had 7 rebounds and a game-winner shot to end the Rocket's streak.</p>
