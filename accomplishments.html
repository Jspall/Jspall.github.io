   <p>After I worked at Mcdonalds for about 2 years then did the Immigraion course  start my own business. My friend and I both did the course and thought that it would be a good idea to be together and start an immigration business. After about 1 year doing the course and clearing all the tests for us to start a business, we finally started negociationg with people and I asked my uncle for advice as he owns a business for immigration.</p></div>
