   My accomplishments in Elementary
   </h2>
   <hr>
   <p>In elemetary, I did have really good grades. Even though this really doesn't count as an accomplishment, I was the first student to get straight A's for 4 classes straight from 1998. I also was never absent in elementary for a single day</p></div>

   <p>
    I didn't really have any accomplishments in high school but later on in my life, I did a course of immigration. Me and my friend who i knew from high school, we were both doing this couse and thought it was a good idea that we would do the course together and later on start a business together for immigration. We cleared all our tests and started negociating with other people and had some advice from my uncle as he has a big business of immigration. After 1 year of doing the course, we finally opened our business.
